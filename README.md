# Gongfucha: Online Tea Shop Database

## Summary
* Work in progress
This is our second version of GongFuTea.org site, rebuilt in React and Node. 

## Technical Stack
* HTML/CSS
* React/Redux
* Node
* MongoDB
* Heroku & HerokuDB (deployment and database)
* Google Maps API -OR- Leaflet
* Google Places API

## Features

#### Maps location data
We originally used the Google Maps API, and are extending both the Google Maps and Google Places functionality for this second version.

#### User-curated database
We want our users to identify and submit their own favorite tea shops, tea houses and tea plantations, rather than rely on information from Google. All of the tea locations in our database have been selected and submitted by users.

### Information on the best online retailers and tea shops.
We provide updated information on both where you can visit the best tea shops across the nation, and where you can fins the best deals for tea online.
